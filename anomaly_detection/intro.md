# Anomaly Detection
**Anomalies** are data points that are different from other observations in some way, typically measured against a model fit to the data.

We assume the anomaly detection task is unsupervised, i.e. we donâ€™t have training data with points labeled as anomalous. Each data point passed to an anomaly detection model is given an score from 0 to infinity indicating how different the point is relative to the rest of the dataset. The calculation of this score varies between models, but a higher score always indicates a point is more anomalous. Often a threshold is chosen to make a final classification of each point as typical or anomalous; this post-processing step is left to the user.

The [GraphLab Create Anomaly Detection toolkit](https://dato.com/products/create/docs/graphlab.toolkits.anomaly_detection.html) currently includes three models for two different data contexts: **local outlier factor**, for detecting outliers in multivariate data that are assumed to be independently and identically distributed, **moving Z-score**, for scoring outliers in a univariate, sequential dataset, typically a time series, and **bayesian changepoints** for identifying changes in the mean or variance of a sequential series.

The anomaly detection toolkit is in active development, and feedback is very welcome.
